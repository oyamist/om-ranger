# Hap&#x2713;eRanger - Haptic Electronic Ranger (Infrared TOF)
### Touch-free visual assistance
### "Happy ranging"
Support canes used by the blind have a major drawback in that
they can whack people from behind unintentionally.  This is clearly
awkward for both the blind and the sighted.

The OM-Ranger uses a Class 1 (safe to the naked eye) 
IR Time-of-fligh (TOF) laser to detect near objects.
Tactile feedback on the range of detected objects is provided by
a Linear Resonant Actuator (LRA) haptic device.

The OM-Ranger uses [TinyCircuits](https://tinycircuits.com) hardware
and is implemented with the [[OMilli]] multi-threaded operating system
for microcontrollers.
